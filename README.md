## TATA REVENUE REPORT
# Background Information
We had a dataset that contained details about the company's sales in 2010 and 2011. The dataset
comprised the following columns: customer id, the product they bought, the time and date when
they made purchases, and the customer's country of residence.
The original dataset had a total of 541,910 rows and 531,284 rows after the data was cleaned.

Cleaning and preparing the data involved:
● Removing duplicate values.
● Removing irrelevant data from the unit price and quantity columns.

# The objective of the Analysis
The company has been performing well and the management would want to analyze the major
contributing factors to the revenue so that they can strategically plan for the next year. They are
interested in looking at the metrics from both an operational and marketing perspective.
The management is also looking to expand its business operations and would like to know areas
that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also love
to view the metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

increase/decrease?
