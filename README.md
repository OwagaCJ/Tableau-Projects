# TATA REVENUE REPORT
## Background Information
We had a dataset that contained details about the company's sales in 2010 and 2011. The dataset
comprised the following columns: customer id, the product they bought, the time and date when
they made purchases, and the customer's country of residence.
The original dataset had a total of 541,910 rows and 531,284 rows after the data was cleaned.

Cleaning and preparing the data involved:
● Removing duplicate values.
● Removing irrelevant data from the unit price and quantity columns.

## The objective of the Analysis
The company has been performing well and the management would want to analyze the major
contributing factors to the revenue so that they can strategically plan for the next year. They are
interested in looking at the metrics from both an operational and marketing perspective.
The management is also looking to expand its business operations and would like to know areas
that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also love
to view the metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

## Questions to be answered
### 1. What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest
increase/decrease?

The management requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any seasonality in the store
sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year when exceptional growth is
witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average
revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the
month of September when the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend
continues till the month of November when it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the
entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December, therefore, no conclusion can be
drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by
seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.

### 2. Which region is generating the highest revenue?

The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are
performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and the
management is more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis
shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France have high volumes
of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused on
to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

### 3. Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue?

The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most
from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made
by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue-generating customer only purchased 17% more
than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to
generate revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is
in a good position.

### 4. Which region has the greatest demand for the products?

Lastly, the bubble chart shows the regions that have the highest demand for products compared
to those that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as the Netherlands,
Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should
invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The chart also shows that most of the
sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia do
not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these areas
has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability
